        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prep Work</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it's very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the chicken broth, marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. </strong>Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375Â°.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water.</strong></li>
                    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Assemble</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles,</strong> overlapping them if needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 and 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Top with 2 and 1/2 cups of Mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> <em>Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes.</strong></li>
                    <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</strong> to allow the layers to set.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
