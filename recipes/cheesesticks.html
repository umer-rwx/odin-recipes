        <p>These fried cheese sticks are very easy to make at home and take just minutes to fry!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 oz. package) mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to <strong>365°F (185°C)</strong> in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
            <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
            <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3/4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat for remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
